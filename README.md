# Historic Fire NE USA
Graduate work from the University of Vermont: code, data and analysis

This research uses a global dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) to determine whether past forest fires were driven by climate or intentional ignition by Indigenous people on the pre-colonial landscape of the Northeastern United States. The model requires 1200 years of input climate data in NCO file format. Output contains forest compositional data, including leaf area index, stem density and stand age. 

R_scripts: contains R scripts numbered in order that analysis took place. 
data: contains target datasets. FIA (forest inventory and analysis) data for present day forests. Witness tree data for forests at the time of European land surveys and settlement (1623-1850). LPJ-GUESS output.
